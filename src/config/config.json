Note that patterns of greater gene content similarity suggest the evolutionary relatedness of these segments; note too, that soybean's chromosome 12 contains two regions homeologous to each other due to structural rearrangements following WGD. Segments from a couple of lupin species have been brought in through the tool's capability to search for related tracks; one of these shows a partial inversion relative to the others."
